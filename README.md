# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project tasked us with utilizing statistics and hypothesis tested to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. All of the statistical analysis and visualizations is written in the R programming language.

## Resources
- Data Source:
- Software: RStudio

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

### The variable/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of 

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?



- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
